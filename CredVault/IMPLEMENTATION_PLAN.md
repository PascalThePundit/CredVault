# CredVault Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan based on the system architecture.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup

### 1.1 Project Initialization
- [x] Set up Next.js project with Solana wallet integration
- [x] Configure Anchor workspace
- [x] Initialize Git repository and basic project structure
- [x] Set up environment configurations

### 1.2 Smart Contract Development
- [x] Implement core credential account structure
- [x] Create credential issuance functionality
- [x] Implement credential verification functions
- [x] Add role-based access controls (issuer, user, employer)
- [x] Implement non-transferable (soulbound) credential tokens
- [x] Add IPFS metadata integration

### 1.3 Frontend Foundation
- [x] Create basic UI layout with header/navigation
- [x] Implement wallet connection functionality
- [x] Set up authentication context
- [x] Create credential display components
- [x] Implement profile management

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation

### 2.1 Credential Issuance System
- [x] Create issuer dashboard UI
- [x] Implement credential creation workflow
- [x] Integrate with Anchor program for credential minting
- [x] Add credential metadata creation and IPFS upload
- [ ] Implement batch credential issuance

### 2.2 Credential Verification System
- [ ] Create verification dashboard for employers
- [ ] Implement credential verification API
- [ ] Add verification history tracking
- [ ] Implement employer permission system

### 2.3 User Profile & Credential Management
- [x] Create user profile pages
- [x] Implement credential display
- [x] Add profile editing functionality
- [ ] Implement credential sharing permissions

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### 3.1 Credential Discovery
- [ ] Implement credential browsing for employers
- [ ] Add search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Create credential recommendation system

### 3.2 Identity & Reputation System
- [ ] Implement user verification levels
- [ ] Add issuer reputation tracking
- [ ] Create credential validity scoring

### 3.3 Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] Add credential analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement usage reporting
- [ ] Create credential impact metrics

## Phase 4: Integration & Deployment

### 4.1 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for smart contract functions
- [ ] Integration tests for frontend components
- [ ] End-to-end testing for user workflows
- [ ] Security audit of smart contracts

### 4.2 Deployment
- [ ] Deploy smart contract to devnet
- [ ] Deploy frontend to hosting platform
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Specifications
- Written in Rust using Anchor framework
- Uses Solana Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for credential accounts
- Implements token metadata program for NFT creation
- Follows SPL token standards

### Frontend Specifications
- Built with Next.js framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Solana wallet adapter for wallet connectivity
- React Query for state management

### Data Storage Specifications
- On-chain: Credential ownership, issuer info, and basic metadata
- Off-chain (IPFS): Detailed credential information, images, and documents
- Client: User preferences and session data

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: Wallet-based authentication with Solana addresses
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control in the smart contract
3. **Immutability**: On-chain records that cannot be altered
4. **Verification**: Multi-step verification for credential authenticity
5. **Privacy**: User-controlled data sharing with employers

## Performance Considerations

1. **Gas Optimization**: Efficient PDA usage and account management
2. **Scalability**: Offloading metadata to IPFS reduces chain storage costs
3. **User Experience**: Caching and indexing for fast credential retrieval
4. **Network Efficiency**: Batch operations where appropriate

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local Anchor development environment
- Solana devnet for testing
- Local IPFS node for metadata storage

### Staging Environment
- Solana devnet for smart contract deployment
- Vercel for frontend hosting
- Production IPFS for metadata storage

### Production Environment
- Solana mainnet for final deployment
- CDN-based frontend hosting
- IPFS-based metadata storage
- Monitoring with third-party tools

This implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for building and deploying the CredVault platform according to the specified architecture.
